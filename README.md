This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

I've created this webpage using NextJS to learn about the technology. This seems to me like a React framework for simplifying things. Very useful and strightforwad, easy to use and to mantain/scale.

The project is a very simple website to store personal contacts. It is so simple to make and yet allows you to learn about the basics of this technology.

## Getting Started
https://contact-list-phi.vercel.app/ <------ go to the APP!
